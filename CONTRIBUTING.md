# Contributing to instagram-cli

Thank you for contributing to instagram-cli, and welcome to the force against brainrot!

## Project Structure

This repository contains **two separate clients** for Instagram:

- **Python Client** (`instagram/` folder)
- **TypeScript Client** (`instagram-ts/` folder)

Choose the client you want to work on based on your preferences and the feature you're implementing.

The team is primarily focused on actively developing the TypeScript client. However, both clients are maintained actively.

## Getting Started

### Python Client Development

To get started with the Python client, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/instagram-cli.git
cd instagram-cli
```

Create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

To create a development build:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### TypeScript Client Development

For the TypeScript client, navigate to the TypeScript directory:

```bash
cd instagram-ts
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To build and run during development:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start -- <command>  # Replace instagram with "npm run start"
npm start -- <command>  # This allows you to pass in flags / arguments properly
```

> [!TIP]
> When making UI changes, we highly encourage using the extensive mocking system in place to avoid making excessive API calls to Instagram. Start the mock UI with `npm run start:mock -- --chat | --feed`. Mocks are currently only supported for the Chat and Feed views. You should update the mock data when making changes to relevant client endpoints.

For example:

```bash
npm run start auth login
npm run start chat
```

## Code Quality and Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks for both Python and TypeScript. To set up:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This automatically formats and lints your code when you commit.

### Manual Code Quality Checks

**Python:**

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

**TypeScript:**

```bash
cd instagram-ts
npm run format
npm run lint-check
```

## How to Contribute

> If you are experienced in contributing to open-source projects, you only need to go over sections 1 and 4.

### 1. Create an Issue

Before working on any changes, **you must first create an issue** in the [Issues](../../issues) section so that everyone is informed and you can receive feedback from others in the community and maintainers. Your issue should fall into one of these categories:

- **Bug Report** â€“ If you've found a bug, please provide clear steps to reproduce it.
- **Feature Request** â€“ If you have an idea for a new feature, describe its purpose and how it improves the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please clearly indicate that you are working on the issue by commenting or assigning yourself to it. Otherwise, we assume the issue is up for grabs or will be worked on by maintainers.

### 2. Fork the Repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supreme-gg-gg/instagram-cli.git
cd instagram-cli
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

Create a new branch based on the issue youâ€™re working on:

```bash
git checkout -b fix-bug-123  # For bug fixes
git checkout -b feature-new-command  # For new features
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Type annotations (from `typing`) and docstrings are required for all functions and methods.
- We prefer object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm over functional and procedural programming.
- Test your changes before submitting. _For UI changes, provide screenshots or GIFs._ For backend changes, we do not have unit tests (for now) but make sure your changes work as expected and handle edge cases.

> [!TIP]
> During development, we recommend using a secondary Instagram account if you are making a lot of API calls to avoid appearing suspicious to Instagram.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Once you're done with your changes:

1. Push your branch to your forked repository: `git push origin feature-new-command`
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of this repository.
3. In your PR description, mention the issue number it resolves (e.g., `Closes #123`).
4. Wait for review and respond to any feedback.

### 6. Code Review & Merging

- Your PR will be reviewed, and maintainers may request changes.

### 7. Releases and Versioning

You don't need to worry about changing version numbers; maintainers will handle that during the release process.

Releases are created manually through GitHub's release page. We use different tag conventions for each client:

- **Python Client**: Use `v1.4.2`, `v1.5.0`, etc.
- **TypeScript Client**: Use `ts-v1.0.0`, `ts-v1.1.0-beta`, etc.

**Semantic Versioning:**

- Bug fixes increment the patch version (e.g., `1.0.1`)
- New features increment the minor version (e.g., `1.1.0`)
- Breaking changes increment the major version (e.g., `2.0.0`)
